## Overview

The team at Home Court aims to simplify the process of finding and organizing pick-up games so you can focus on playing the sports you love. 

Home Court was built with Google Maps as the centerpiece. Upcoming events will dynamically render onto a list based on your current location or wherever the user navigates to on Google Maps. Joining and unjoining an event is a frictionless process which can be executed with a single click. Users can also host events by pinning a location onto the map and completing a single form.

To achieve this, we:
* Integrated Google Maps API into our app with filters
* Built a mongoDB non-relational database to store users and event information
* Constructed a web application for visualization of and interaction with the collected data
